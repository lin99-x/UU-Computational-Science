- Group Members:
    - Aoping Lyu <aoping.lyu.6830@student.uu.se>
    - Jinglin Gao <jinglin.gao.1941@student.uu.se>

### Key Paper Review
#### Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions

- Paper link: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2209.15180


### Code 

- Github Link: https://github.com/TT27Bon/INR-project.git

### Progress
- Finish experiment with Siren **[JG]**
- Write report skeleton **[AL]** **[JG]**
- Use PSNR evaluate the compression result, define compression rate **[JG]**
- Run SCI experiment with cropped data of the tumour centre **[AL]**
- Compare the results between SCI and Siren, choose one as input of the interface **[AL]** **[JG]**

### Oral presentation training - 12/04
- Clear the structure of the presentation   
- Potentially add rhetorical questions to the presentation for better interaction with the audience and smooth transition between different parts of the presentation
- Point to the figures in the presentation to make the presentation more clear
- Provide silence to the audience to let them think about the content
- Apply more time to the pipeline part of the presentation


### Work for next week
- Study the interface between MLP and CNN
- Construct interface


### Proposed Pipeline:
- Data Pre-procesessing and Representation **(DONE)**
- Construct Neural Network Model **(DONE)**
- Training the Model **(DONE)**
- Encoding and Decoding     **(Partially DONE)**
- Optimization and Evaluation
- Visualisation and Interaction
- Downstream Application
