### Key Paper Review
#### SCI: A Spectrum Concentrated Implicit Neural Compression for Biomedical Data

- Paper link: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2209.15180
    - Focuses on compressing biomedical data, distinct from natural images/videos.
    - Introduces Spectrum Concentrated Implicit neural compression (SCI) based on Implicit Neural Representation (INR).
    - Adapts data into blocks matching INR’s concentrated spectrum envelope.
    - Utilizes a funnel-shaped network for efficient data representation.
    - Implements a parameter allocation strategy for accurate data representation.

    

### Work for next week
- Reproduce the implicit neural compression method using in the found paper.
- Apply it to the 3D data we have.

### Proposed Pipeline:
- Data Pre-procesessing and Representation
- Construct Neural Network Model
- Training the Model
- Encoding and Decoding
- Optimization and Evaluation
- Visualisation and Interaction
- Downstream Application
